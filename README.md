# Personal-Programs using purely python/numpy for better understanding (No external libraries such as Tensorflow, Theano etc. is used in these programs)

Each Directory contains description on how to use files.

In this repository, i am giving following implementations.

Supervised Learning:
1) Implememtation of paper "Weight Uncertainty in Neural Networks" https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05424
   Bayes_Linear_regression_classification: 
   Here i implemented for Sine curve and MNIST dataset.

2) Implementation of 
   Linear Regression task on XOR truth table and Dummy data (File name: Regression_sigmoid_linear.ipnb),
   and Classification tasks on MNIST (File name: Vanilla_Neural_Network_Classification_Task_MNIST.ipynb) using Python/Numpy


Reinforcement Learning Algorithms:

1) Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithm (File Name: DDPG.ipynb)
   Implementation of paper : "Continuous control with deep reinforcement learning" https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971
